## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**diogo-mendes-neves/diogo-mendes-neves** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on to build a DevOps career
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some of the most importantes topics to a DevOps career like Terraform, Docker, Jenkins, the concepts of a DevOps culture such as CI/CD and integratino between teams
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Instagram and LinkedIn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to reading more than watching movies and series, and I'm more curious than usual (about everything)
