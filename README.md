## Hi there 👋


**diogo-mendes-neves/diogo-mendes-neves** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on to build a DevOps career
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some of the most importantes topics to a DevOps career like Terraform, Docker, Jenkins, the concepts of a DevOps culture such as CI/CD and integratino between teams
- 📫 How to reach me: Instagram and LinkedIn
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to reading more than watching movies and series, and I'm more curious than usual (about everything)
